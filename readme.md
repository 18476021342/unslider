Unslider
========

The easiest way to get a simple slider up and running in seconds. All you need
is some valid markup, jQuery and some extra CSS, and Unslider can do the rest.

### Out-of-the-box features

- Slides things (obviously)
- Left/right arrow keyboard navigation
- Auto-generated slide navigation
- Clickable arrows
- Touch support

### Unslider extensions

- Infinite scroll (instead of looping back to the start)
- Fade effect (instead of sliding things)
- Much more...
